Springboard Capstone Project #1: Baseball Predicting Wins

This project uses Linear Regression with batting and pitching statistics taken
from Major League Baseball (MLB) seasons from 1876-2018 to predict a team's number
of wins. Statistics were taken from baseball-reference.com. The data in the form
of a csv file is available here [https://github.com/swlew369/Capstone_1_Lew/blob/master/MLB_STATS_1876-2018_BP.csv]
